Hack the Hill 2024
Ross Video FPGA Challenge

This solution was created by a group of 5 computer engineers from various universities. The challenge was to output a moving shape instead of the default color bars on a monitor. This was achieved by using port 15 on Ross' Ultrix device, and using one of three chips on it as a FPGA to acheive our desired movement.
